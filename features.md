Certainly! For machine learning (ML) to perform stuttering detection in speech, you’ll need to extract various features from the audio that represent the characteristics of speech and stuttering patterns. Here’s a list of key features that can be useful for training a model to detect stuttering:

1. Time Domain Features
Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR): Measures how frequently the signal changes polarity (from positive to negative or vice versa). Higher ZCR might indicate more chaotic or disrupted speech.
Energy: Total energy in a speech signal (based on the magnitude of the signal). Large fluctuations in energy might correlate with disfluency or stuttering.
Root Mean Square (RMS) Energy: Measures the magnitude of the audio signal, which can be related to voice intensity. Variations in RMS could indicate disruptions in speech flow.
Signal Duration: Time duration of different speech segments (phonemes, syllables, or words), particularly when unusually long.
2. Frequency Domain Features
Spectral Centroid: Measures the "center of mass" of the spectrum. A large deviation in spectral centroid could indicate abnormal speech, potentially linked to stuttering.
Spectral Flux: Measures the change in spectral content from one frame to the next. High flux could reflect a speech disruption like a stutter.
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs): Widely used to represent the short-term power spectrum of speech. MFCCs capture timbral characteristics of speech and can help identify irregularities or changes due to stuttering.
Chroma Features: Measures pitch class distributions, capturing harmonic aspects of the speech. Sudden shifts could help detect stuttering events.
Formants (F1, F2, F3, etc.): Resonant frequencies of speech. Disruptions in formant trajectories can signal irregular speech patterns, like those seen in stuttering.
3. Prosodic Features
Pitch (Fundamental Frequency): The baseline pitch of speech. Stuttering may involve changes in pitch, such as prolonged or repeated pitches.
Pitch Variation / Jitter: Variability in pitch over time. Increased jitter could be a sign of stuttering.
Speech Rate: The number of syllables, words, or phonemes per unit of time. A slower speech rate might indicate stuttering, as individuals may pause or repeat words.
Pause Duration: Measures the length of silent gaps between words or syllables. Longer or unusually frequent pauses might indicate stuttering.
Speech Flow (Rhythm and Tempo): Changes in rhythm or tempo, especially repetitive rhythm, might be associated with stuttering.
4. Temporal Features
Syllable Duration: The length of time taken to pronounce individual syllables or words. Unusual lengthening of syllables could indicate a stuttering block or prolongation.
Word Repetition Count: Detect how often words or syllables are repeated. Repetition is a hallmark of stuttering.
Onset Time (Voice Onset Time - VOT): The time taken for the speaker to begin producing a sound after starting to speak. A prolonged VOT could signify stuttering.
5. Higher-Level Statistical Features
Mean, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis of Speech Features: Descriptive statistical measures on different speech parameters (e.g., pitch, MFCCs, energy) can help identify irregular patterns in speech.
Autocorrelation: This measures how speech patterns repeat over time and can help identify repetitive speech patterns typical of stuttering.
6. Disfluency Detection Features
Interruption Patterns: Patterns of interruptions in speech flow, such as multiple starts and stops, can be an indicator of stuttering.
Repetition Frequency: Number of times a word or part of a word is repeated within a specific time window. Stuttering is often marked by this repetition.
Prolongation: Measure how long a particular sound or syllable is sustained, as stuttering often involves extended sounds.
7. Other Features
Formant Transition: Look at how quickly the formants transition between vowels or consonants, which may change in the presence of stuttering.
Voice Quality (Shimmer): Measures variations in amplitude. Stuttering might cause variations in vocal quality, especially if the speaker is struggling to maintain a steady voice.
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW): This technique compares sequences of speech data to find optimal alignments. It can help identify speech irregularities.
Summary of the Key Features to Extract for ML:
Time Domain Features: Zero-crossing rate, energy, RMS energy, signal duration.
Frequency Domain Features: Spectral centroid, spectral flux, MFCCs, chroma features, formants.
Prosodic Features: Pitch, jitter, speech rate, pause duration, rhythm and tempo.
Temporal Features: Syllable duration, word repetition count, voice onset time.
Higher-Level Statistical Features: Mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, autocorrelation.
Disfluency Detection Features: Repetition, prolongation, interruption patterns.
Voice Quality Features: Shimmer, dynamic time warping (DTW).
Tools for Feature Extraction:
Librosa: A Python library for audio analysis that provides easy-to-use functions for extracting MFCCs, spectral features, pitch, etc.
Praat: A tool for phonetic analysis, useful for extracting formants and other voice characteristics.
OpenSMILE: A feature extraction toolkit that can be used to extract many of the prosodic and spectral features needed for speech analysis.
By extracting these features and using them in machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, neural networks, etc.), you can train a model to detect stuttering in speech.
