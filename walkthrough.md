 - what is jitter and shimmer
 - usual values for normal, low, mild ...
 - also find, wpm, pauses in speech (1 min)

now generate data for normal, low, mild...

Combined Table: Jitter, Shimmer, WPM, and Pauses for Speech Defect Severity
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity of Defect	Jitter (%)	Jitter (ms)	Shimmer (%)	Shimmer (dB)	WPM (Words per Minute)	Pauses (Frequency)	Pauses (Duration)
No Defect	0-0.5%	<0.5 ms	0-1%	<0.5 dB	120-150 WPM	Few or none	Short (less than 1 sec)
Low Defect	0.5-1%	0.5-1 ms	1-2%	0.5-1 dB	100-120 WPM	Few to moderate	1-2 seconds
Mild Defect	1-2%	1-2 ms	2-3%	1-2 dB	85-100 WPM	Moderate	2-4 seconds
